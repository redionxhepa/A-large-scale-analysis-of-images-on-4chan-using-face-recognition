### Dependencies and libriaries to be installed

The following libraries were used to perform the experiments. The versions do not have to be exactly but we are showing them to be consistent.

## How to run the pipeline


## Read the entities


```
python readTheEntities.py --input --output
```
Explanations to be added for each parameter.



## Text file creator

This scripts take the path of a directory and saves all the the paths of the images found in all the subdirectories. One can decide where to store the paths (it creates by default a new folder). Also one can decide into how many different .txt files you want to store the image paths.


``` 
  filePathTextFileCreator.py --imagesFolderPath --txtFolderPath --parts
```

The _parts_ variable will take care the fact of how many .txt you want to save your output. Please be careful when you rerun this script because it might overwrite the old files (.txt file) so it is better to simply delete the previous output or simply give a new path for the folder where to store these .txt file. The _txtFolderPath_ is the full path of the folder where to store the .txt file. If it does not exist the script will simply create a new folder with the given name in the local path where the _filePathTextFileCreator.py_ is.

## Feature Extractor

This script processes all the images in a folder and then saves the encodings in a ndjson file.


``` 
  python featureExtractorParallelized.py --imagesTextFile --ndjsonFolderPath --workers --epsilon --jitter --jsonFile
```

By now you need only to give the full path of the images (as a text file) and the script will output the encodings of the images in a ndjson file. All the parameters have default value but for sure one needs to input the path of the text file which containts the paths of the images.



### Run the DB-SCAN clustering algorithm

The input can be of two formats. Either you give the full path of the encodings/feature vectors stacked as a matrix or you give the precalculated distances.

```
python dbscan.py --distancesCalculated --inputPath --outputFolder --epsilon --minSamples
```
Explanations to be added for each parameter.



### Visualization

```
python visualize.py  --output --labels --imagesPath
```
Explanations to be added for each parameter.
